      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

    <noscript>Make money even though NFTs, like Cryptocurrencies, appear to have utility for most, the industry is plagued with a lot of speculation, and while there are most are losers, players still manage to emerge victorious from the market; If you master NFTs and the Blockchain, you will be able to take advantage of new Web3 features, such as Play to Earn, Run To Earn, Share To Earn (SocialFi), etc... So why shouldnâ€™t you try? Begin now playing the newest platform "Wear to Earn" developed by F-NFT! These reward you in the form of objects, just like any other game, except that these objects are NFTs, which means they are immutable or exchangeable and sellable and of course, you generate income from your own understanding</noscript>
